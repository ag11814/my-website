  slowly adding walls to floors and then your roof customizing it freely. you could even make a basment with the gamepass, a decent house should consist at least <br> 
  one floor, roof, garden and lights advanced placment is optional but builds turn out better if used. making the outside of your house looking more natural, diferent <br>
  shades of the same color can give a more experianced and natural look.</p>

  <p> how to enter build mode: Players can enter Build Mode by interacting with their mailbox that is automatically attached to the front of their plot, 
<br> then 'Build Mode', or clicking the house button on the bottom right side of their screen when they are in Bloxburg while on their plot. <br> </p>
  
  <h5> 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱? </h5>
  
  <p>Create an empty plot. You will be given a free plot and a default home when you join the game for the first time. To make additional plots, it will cost you Blockbux, <br> a currency that must be bought with Robux, which is the currency of Roblox costing real-life USD. <br> If you cannot make a new plot, sell your starter house or current house.
For example, if your house was worth $7,000, you'll only earn $4,900 back. <br>  If you don't want to lose money, use Blockbux to create an entirely new plot and save your house. </p>
  <p>
Think of a theme for your house. Decide if you want it to be modern, victorian, a farmhouse, suburban, etc. Choosing a style is normally <br> difficult unless you know exactly what you want. Some descriptions of each house are listed below if you don't know what you want: <br>
Modern-style houses have a tilted or flat roof, wooden walls, large rectangular windows, pillars, and an aesthetic color scheme. <br>
Victorian-style houses have a gable roof, wooden/brick walls, average-sized windows, shutters, pillars, and a monochromatic or vintage color scheme. <br>
Farmhouses have a gambrel roof, wooden walls, open windows, shutters, pillars, and a warm or aesthetic color scheme. <br>
Suburban houses have a gable roof, plastic (texture) or wooden walls, average-sized windows, shutters, pillars, and a monochromatic or analogous color scheme. <br>
 </p> 
  <p>
Make a plan for your house. When you build, it's maybe more difficult when you don't know what you want. Decide on the following to make building easier and more fun: <rb>
What rooms do you need?
How many rooms?
What game passes do you have?
Building on a small budget, or with a large amount of money?
Will you add a pool or backyard?
How about a front yard?
Do you intend on having a family?
 </p>
  <p>
Open Bloxburg's build mode. This will give you the option to edit your current plot. If you go to your mailbox and press E (or tap on it for mobile), <rb> the option to enter build mode should appear, along with some other convenient options. Click "Build Mode" and you should be standing on your plot, ready to build. <rb>
 </p>
  <p> 
Place the walls. Make sure there's at least space for a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, a bathroom, and a garage. Here are some optional rooms <rb> that you can add for decoration or roleplay: <rb>
Movie room
Playroom
Study
Laundry room
Reading room</p>
  <p>
Create the floor. Add the floor by clicking each corner from left to right, or right to left. To make it quicker and easier, click the automatic version. <rb> If you place it manually, make sure you don't skip a corner! <rb> </p>
  <p> 
Make a door for your house. A door is essential; without them, you can't enter your building. Place a door that fits the house. The best door isn't the most expensive door - it's the door that matches your house and fits in with the color scheme.
</p>
  <p> Add windows. Don't spam windows everywhere, though - instead, place them in spots where they're functional and won't be blocked by stairs, bookshelves, cabinets, beds, etc. It's helpful to place them in these types of <rb> places because you'll be able to see if someone is trying to enter your house or if someone is outside.
</p>
  <p> Build the roof. This works a lot like the floor, except it's on top of walls or pillars rather than below them. You can have the roof automatically placed or manually. <rb> It's all up to you since this is your own unique house. <rb>
</p>
  <p>
Decorate your house. Click the Decorations button on the bottom left of your screen, and add objects like plants, paths, garden lights, <rb> tables and chairs, doorbells, etc. This is optional, but a nice finishing touch for an aesthetic exterior. <rb>
 </p>
  <p>
Paint the exterior of your house. The paint tool can be found on the bottom of your screen or activated by the F button on your keyboard. <rb> The part of the house you're painting should turn blue when you hover over it. <rb> Add textures and colors of the color scheme you've selected. Don't forget to paint both sides of the walls! <rb>
 </p>
  <p>
Light up your build! Again, don't spam lights, but add them in places where they make sense. Making light brown or gray lights keep your house from appearing too bright. <rb> Many experienced builders use "linen lighting" to prevent extreme brightness. <rb>
 </p>
  <p> Create the living room. Living rooms are crucial to a detailed build for both living and roleplaying. A living room normally consists of: <rb>
Storage (i.e. bookshelves, boxes)
Decorations
A television
A coffee table
Sofas and armchairs</p>
  <p> Decorate the kitchen. Kitchens are used for increasing your moods or cooking level and are essential to functional houses. A kitchen normally consists of: <rb>
Counters and islands
Microwaves and stoves
Coffee makers and kettles
Decorations
Stools</p>
  <p>
Add furniture to your bedroom. Your bedroom is one of the most important rooms in both real houses and Bloxburg houses. Bedrooms usually consist of: <rb>
Beds
Desks
Dressers and closets
Decorations
Storage (i.e. bookshelves, boxes)
Curtains
 </p>
  <p> 
Move onto the bathroom. This is another important room for your house since even Robloxians have to clean up. Bathrooms usually consist of:<rb>
Toilets
showers or bathtubs
Counters
Sinks
Decorations
</p>
  <p> 
Decorate any optional rooms. You can skip this part of the process if you don't have any, but if you do, add anything you'd expect in that room. <rb> As an example, when decorating a movie room, add a television, armchairs, potted plants, paintings, popcorn machines, etc.
</p>
  <p>

Paint the interior of your house. The paint tool can be found on the bottom of your screen or activated by pressing the F button on your keyboard. <rb> The part of the house you're painting should turn blue when you hover over it. Add textures and colors of the color scheme you've selected.
